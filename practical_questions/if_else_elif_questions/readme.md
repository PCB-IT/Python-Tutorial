## Please acknowledge
In order to receive user feedback you need to make use of the ```input("<User message>")``` function. It displays a message in the terminal and then waits for the user to enter a input. It will then return an assignable string as an output,.

```python
my_name = input("What is your name?")
```

Note that if you want to receive number inputs you need to convert it to a integer with ```int(string)```.

```python
number_as_string = input("Enter number: ")
# number_as_string is a string

number_as_int = int(number_as_string )
# number_as_int is a int
# This now converts the string value into an integer and then assigns it to a variable called number_as_int 
```
